# Project 2: Wordle, the Card game.
### Team member: Andi Dong, Jianan Wang

This project is a popular single player word game called Wordle.

## What were some challenges you faced while making this app?

We do have a few challenges, for example:
1. How to put the keyboard inside the game page.
2. How to set the reset button's position to make it obvious to the players but not hiding our parts in three difficulties.
3. How to use redux to store data is the biggest challenges we've met.
4. How to save the data in order to let user play the game whenever they want and never lose the previous tries.

## Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make

We found that on most of the wordle games, For example, if the correct words has one a, and player types two a, both a would be marked, and it really confused us how many a should the correct words has, so if we have more time, we will make the rule clearer, if we the correct words only have one a, we shall only mark one as well.
